# SnakeJS

Hello, this game is based upon codeplayer's snake game example found
<a href="http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/html5-game-tutorial-make-a-snake-game-using-html5-canvas-jquery" target="_blank">here</a>.
Enjoy!

You can see it live at <a href="https://bbranko.github.io/SnakeJS/">https://bbranko.github.io/SnakeJS/</a>

## Stuff done:
 - added instructions.html and published game on github pages
 - dropped jQuery
 - split code into sub-modules within one file
 - split snake.js into separate files via loose augmentation, BUT with keeping private stuff still private

## To be done:
 - more game logic, ie speed up with score and time ++
 - add some control buttons to set initial state
 - AI?
 - ...
