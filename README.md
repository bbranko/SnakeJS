# SnakeJS

Hello, this game is based upon codeplayer's snake game example found
<a href="http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/html5-game-tutorial-make-a-snake-game-using-html5-canvas-jquery" target="_blank">here</a>.
Enjoy!

## Stuff done:

 - split code into sub-modules within one file

 - more game logic, ie speed up with score and time ++
 - add some control buttons to set initial state
 - AI?
